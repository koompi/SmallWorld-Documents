It is with great honor for KOOMPI to partner with one of the leading business institutions in Cambodia whose mission is to provide learners with the superior quality of higher education service and professional training in business education to build their knowledge, professional skills, experiences, ethics, and networking.


We hope that this partnership will enable a more utilized study space for the students and teachers of AIB. By introducing open-source technology to the banking and fintech sector, students can learn even more about collaborative software technology. In an evolving digital scene, this is one of the best methods that can accelerate innovation in financial services.
