 ### KOOMPI Onelab
What was your most memorable school day?

It was always a treat when our teacher unexpectedly brought a television into the classroom. Another session to look forward to might be computer classes, in which Mario Typing was all the craze, or should we say, the essential typing program.

Our experience with electronics was limited, but nostalgic nonetheless. These two experiences mentioned were regrettably not available to every student. Some of us couldnâ€™t even attend school, let alone play with technology. Recognizing this disparity is one of the factors that push us to build inclusive projects that inspire young students to reach their potential. 

Under the One-School-One-Lab initiative, KOOMPI Onelab is a playground for students of all backgrounds to explore their inner innovator. With an equipped work station, content server, and internet connection, learning will know no bounds. 

Though NGS Preah Sisowath High School may be the perfect starting point for our project due to its prestige with STEM curriculum, we believe every school deserves to have a study lab and that every student deserves to be exposed to open-ended education.
