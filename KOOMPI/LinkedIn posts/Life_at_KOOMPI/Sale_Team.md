### Sale Team

Our sales team is the heart of the company's operation. Their main task is to assist and provide all the necessary information for KOOMPI users.

Another special task is User' After Service. Not only do they make sure to provide fast and convenient service but they also follow up and gather feedback for improvement.

Apart from working with us, they usually enjoyed playing various sports but more frequently soccer. This is their way of being healthy both physically and mentally. From time to time, they also hang out for movies and this makes the team bonding become closer.

Our sales team is our key player and will remain a vital part of KOOMPI.
