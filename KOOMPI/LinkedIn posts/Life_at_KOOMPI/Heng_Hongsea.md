### Heng Hongsea

Who is behind KOOMPI’s Wifi project? 

With an interest in network technology, Hongsea started off as an apprentice at KOOMPI in 2018. Currently, he is the lead developer in the Network Development Department. His project, KOOMPI Fi-Fi, was initiated to provide internet connection throughout Cambodia, especially remote areas, at an affordable cost. 

He loves listening to podcasts about life and adventures for around half an hour before starting his work during the week. He also contributes to the mechanics team at KOOMPI by fixing customers’ KOOMPI Notebooks. On the weekends, Hongsea takes his bike out for cycling at around 5 am. Due to the lockdown, Hongsea developed a new hobby: working out.

Hongsea is currently pursuing a Bachelor degree in Computer Science, Faculty of Science  at Royal University of Phnom Penh and will graduate in July 2021.
