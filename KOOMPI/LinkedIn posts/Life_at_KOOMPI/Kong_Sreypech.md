### Kong Sreypech

During one of our weekly meetings this week, the communication and digital marketing team at KOOMPI came up with a new kind of story to tell. This time, we want to talk about the people and this week, we feature the least expected person of all. Our cook. 

Her message “Lunch is ready” is probably everyone’s favourite notification on our Telegram. Every morning, Sreypech would arrive in our kitchen with a big bag of groceries in reusable tupperwares. We aren’t sure how she convinced the market vendors to stop shoving plastic bags into her hands for every little thing, but we just know that plastic bags will (not) be sorely missed.

At noon, the room is alive as all of us bustle into it and wolf down on our lunch. It’s a different menu every day, with vegetables and fruits always present on the bar and table. We all appreciate the extra fiber for our digestion. Despite the big volume of food we need every day, Sreypech manages to fill up the plates before 12 pm and leave us a spotless counter before she leaves.

When everyone is busy, lunchtimes are sometimes the only opportunity we get to see our colleagues and wind down for a while. 

None of this would have been possible without Sreypech and we can’t thank her enough.
