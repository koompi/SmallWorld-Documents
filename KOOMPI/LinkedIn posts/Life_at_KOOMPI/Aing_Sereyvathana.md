Who designs KOOMPI OS’s Desktop Environment? 

You must have seen her before in our Women’s Rights video earlier this year. Sereyvathana, more known by us as Cheng, is the only female Linux developer at KOOMPI. 

Cheng is currently working from remote, more specifically her hometown Pursat, since before the country lockdown. As part of the KOOMPI OS Department, Cheng works on the Desktop Environment project for the next version of KOOMPI OS and designs the UI library. 

During her stay in Pursat, she focuses on being productive while maintaining mental and physical health. Outside of work, she loves exercising and usually goes jogging around the neighborhood. The most interesting part is Cheng meditates at home and has been keeping up the practice since 2015. 

Spiritual and mental health is important to Cheng. There was a 10-days វិបាសនា program in Battambang which she joined and gained a lot of self-reflection. She found out that her mental health has become healthier, which in turn improves her physical being. 

It’s important for everyone to be productive at work but also healthy everywhere else. What’s your favorite way to relax? Tell us in the comments!
