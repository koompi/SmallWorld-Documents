### Con Daveat 
Most of us are very attached to our electronics. This is usually the case with computers and mobile phones that have been with us through thick and thin. This image may be ironic considering it looks anything but “attached”. However, it has a beautiful story behind it. 

Every morning, Selendra’s mobile app developer Daveat arrives at his office and sets up his laptop before doing anything else, which is usually making himself a cup of coffee or tea and watering the plants around 11 am after his online class.  

Setting up his laptop, however, isn’t very conventional. His KOOMPI E13, which he bought in February 2020, were broken into two after he regrettably opened it up too aggressively on the daily. Despite this setback, Daveat told KOOMPI team that he is perfectly fine with using it the way it currently is because “why not? It still serves its function the way I need it to.” When asked if he had been interested in replacing it with a new one, he said he’s keeping his budget on other things. 

Before joining Selendra, Daveat was a KOOMPI user who was studying code. Seeing his potential as an aspiring developer, he was invited to test out his abilities and the rest is history.
