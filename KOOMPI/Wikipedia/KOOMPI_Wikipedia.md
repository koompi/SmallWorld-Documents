 
KOOMPI (pronounced koombhee or គម្ពីរ) is a Cambodian information technology company in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Its debut and most well-known product is KOOMPI E13, a compact notebook that runs on an Arch-Linux based OS called KOOMPI OS. Other products developed after **KOOMPI E13** are **KOOMPI E11, SALA KOOMPI, KOOMPI Onelab, KOOMPI Wi-Fi and KOOMPI Hotspot.** KOOMPI is [the first brand in Cambodia](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/business/company-set-launch-koompi-kingdoms-first-domestic-laptop) to produce its own computer and operating system. 

KOOMPI was founded by Rithy Thul, Sela Thul, and Patridge Tembo in 2018. 

## History
### Creation 
Before KOOMPI was a company, it started as a computer recycling project under SmallWorld Venture by Rithy Thul and Sela Thul and advised by Charles Di Bella in 2014. Seeing that students of all ages need affordable computers but may lack the resources to acquire one, the team started to collect old laptops and refurbish them with Linux. The computers are then given to students in need for free. Due to the incompatibility of certain computer models with open-sourced operating systems, the team saw the necessity of producing both hardware and software that can run open-source. 

KOOMPI’s OS Development team is currently led by Brilliant Phal. 

### Meaning 
KOOMPI was named after the Khmer word គម្ពីរ (pronounced koombhee), which means book or source of knowledge. Despite the different pronunciation, the second syllable is also a wordplay of “Pi”, which is the common command line used in the Konsole of KOOMPI’s computer operating system. 

## Board of Directors 
KOOMPI does not have an official Board of Directors but is advised and facilitated by the board of its parent company, [SmallWorld Venture.](https://smallworldventure.com/) 

## Chief Executives Officers 
Sela Thul:     2018 to October 2019
Rithy Thul:    October 2019 - present 

## Marketing
KOOMPI markets their computers as “low-cost”, “full-power”, “off-the-grid”, and  “open-source” notebooks. The target users are those who are open to using alternative operating systems from Microsoft Windows, which has been prevalently used in Cambodia since before the official launch of Windows Server 2008 in July 2008. KOOMPI also targets users who are new to computing, especially young students. 

KOOMPI participates in relevant exhibitions that focus on youth and education. All KOOMPI notebooks are sold directly from their warehouse at a retail price. 

## Corporate identity
### Corporate Culture
As a start-up, KOOMPI stresses the importance of sticking to its mission and vision. All new recruits are told upfront about challenges such as low monthly salary and occasional odd hours. 

KOOMPI’s human resource management is centered around a “no-time wasted” policy. Both the hiring process and probation period is more dependent on a case-by-case basis rather than an official timeline. Most staff at KOOMPI are not selected based on experience or credentials but rather a willingness to contribute to the company and develop themselves in the process. Most of the staff who are working at KOOMPI are young undergraduates between the age of 18 and early 20s. KOOMPI also accepts talents as young as 16 years old into the apprenticeship program. 

### Environment
KOOMPI exercises environmentally-conscious practices that may be considered unconventional in Cambodia. 

The staff are encouraged to not bring in any plastic packaging. Employees store their personal utensils in the office kitchen. The company’s chef uses reusable containers for the daily grocery shopping. 

Most of the staff, including Rithy Thul, use bicycles as their transportation option.

For work retreat or gatherings, waste is discouraged, if not prohibited. The staff makes sure no venue is left in disarray after an event, especially when it’s a natural resort. 

### Headquarters 
During its recycling project stage, KOOMPI was located in Toul Kork. The office was also a networking hub for young IT enthusiasts. The team then relocated to a bigger building in the same area in March 2017. This new headquarter has a storage room, a wider parking lot for the team, and a more community-friendly space. 

Around the end of 2019, KOOMPI moved to its new headquarter and (first) showroom in Daun Penh. This location had a dormitory and was a warehouse to all KOOMPI computers that were to be sold. 

In mid-2021, the staff were offered an option to work at the [Vitamin Air](http://vitaminair.org) site which is located in Kampong Seila, Preah Sihanouk Ville. Staff who did not choose to move to the remote location would work from KOOMPI’s office space at Raintree. The relocation to Chan Krohom is in line with the company’s stock clearance of both KOOMPI notebook models and has actually been the company’s target location since the beginning. 

KOOMPI’s office at Kampong Seila is a nature-oriented housing and office for the staff. Though it is not located in the city, KOOMPI staff have essential facilities and appropriate environment to conduct their research and development projects. 

## Logo 
KOOMPI’s logo design is made up of two books of the same size opened towards each other. This can be seen from all four angles. The star shape that results from this combination symbolises enlightenment and light, which is related to KOOMPI’s name and mission. 

The logo was designed by Panha Sok and Vireak Chandara. 

## Sponsorship and philanthropy
KOOMPI sponsored $5000 for Barcamp in 2018, the same year of KOOMPI E13 launch. 

In 2019, KOOMPI sponsored $8000 along with 10 KOOMPI E13s to Barcamp, $700 to Digital Cambodia, 2 KOOMPI E13s to the Institute of Technology of Cambodia, and 2 KOOMPI E13s to the Union of Youth Federations of Cambodia.

KOOMPI donated 10 KOOMPI E13s and $2000 to Angkor Hospital in 2020. The company also sponsored E11 to JCI. 

## Partner institution loan
