# A literature review of STEM in Cambodia 

Like all Southeast Asia countries, Cambodia is slowly being introduced to technological advancements and thus more [careers](http://oer.moeys.gov.kh/2016/02/STEM-Careers-of-the-Future-in-Cambodia.html) (data analysts, machine-learning specialists, software and application developers, new-technology specialists, etc.) in the digital field have emerged. Based on an [article](https://www.voacambodia.com/a/cambodian-american-sees-stem-programs-as-key-to-cambodia-high-tech-future/3636076.html) by VOA, the Cambodia technological industry is already estimated to be worth as much as $800 million, employing some 30,000 IT professionals. Cambodian-American Allen Dodgson Tan, the managing director of [STEM Cambodia](http://www.stemcambodia.org) (a Cambodian NGO registered with the Ministry of Interior), said Cambodia needs to aggressively invest in STEM education and careers to meet the demand of this growing sector. 

Hang Chuon Naron [said](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/minister-education-students-are-showing-greater-stem-interest) that since MoEYS implemented [examination reforms](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/meet-man-behind-exams), it had begun to address the shortage of engineers and technical experts. Knowledge such as engineering and computer science used to be only conventionally available at university level, meaning university freshmen aren’t necessarily equipped with the necessary foundation knowledge to thrive before they enroll. However, this is slowly changing due to initiatives taken by the government, NGOs, and the youths themselves. 

The youths today have more access to science and technology education. In addition to social sciences and surface-level science classes in high school curriculums, the youths can adopt a more conscious and independent approach to their careers and learning. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS), is actively adopting a modern education platform called STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) to catch up with the new era. We have witnessed many initiatives over the years in the forms of new education curriculums (New Generation Schools) and collaborative NGO programs (E[2STEM, Microsoft Student Partners](https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2016/08/22/microsoft-student-partners-launches-with-stem-cambodia/#sm.0001acvt8kxt9dskxrr2b2ubbn3ju)), STEM fairs/festivals ([STEM Festival, Cambodia Science and Engineering Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/national-olympic-stadium-of-cambodia/5th-cambodia-science-and-engineering-festival-2019/1263024423851280/)), free-entry events (Digital Cambodia organized by Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications), and STEM [workshops](https://www.khmertimeskh.com/539507/boosting-cambodias-stem-curriculum/) (STEM Educator Workshop). 

In addition, educational resources have been revised or improved. According to an article by [Phnom Penh Post](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/government-policy-boost-stem-learning) in 2016, the government has broadly adopted a policy to improve STEM teaching in a bid to turn around the Kingdom’s dismal pass rates for the subjects in the 12th grade national examinations, according to a government official. Onn Sivutha, ministry educational planning specialist, confirmed during a three-day STEM policy workshop organised by UNESCO that MoEYS approved the policy under which STEM textbooks are to be developed, more teachers recruited and trained, and a new curriculum created.

## Do we still need to take more action? 

"Our current education system adapts to change too slowly and operates too ineffectively for this new world," Stephane Kasriel, former CEO of Upwork, writes in an article for the World Economic Forum.
Though Cambodia is taking active steps to adapt to industry 4.0, there are still certain barriers that prevent some youths from acquiring or accessing the information and projects that have been implemented. Factors like demography, lack of technology, financial status, and social norms ([more men than women in tech industry](http://geeksincambodia.com/wedus-womens-leadership-academy-supporting-the-growth-of-young-women-in-tech/)) may need to be addressed or considered for all projects that hope to empower the youths. 

Based on an [article](https://bigthink.com/kenzie-academy/software-engineering-school?fbclid=IwAR0eE44jpkrzqEy6-kZjqANkcFFe6LCll01kQUqNSl_51RGQHBFga63NrQ4) by Big Think published in 2020, “technological advancements are predicted to take as many as 75 million jobs from humans worldwide before 2022. However, 133 million new jobs are expected to be created at that same time.” When we founded KOOMPI in 2018 with the support of SmallWorld Venture, we did not only aim to make big business. We wanted to inspire the youths to believe in their ability to be involved in the technology sector. 

## What is One-School-One-Lab?

**The ultimate mission is to provide students with at least one computer laboratory (with high speed internet connection) per school, regardless of location.** However, we understand the importance of proper guidance in education in addition to physical resources. To implement our project, KOOMPI has been working with various schools and universities in Cambodia by establishing computer labs and assigning at least one facilitator per lab. 


**Who are facilitators? What are their roles?**

With acknowledgement of the importance of learning tools, we also take into consideration the need for effective guidance and assessment. The  facilitator’s role is not only to “teach”, but to gauge students’ curiosity and obstacles and deliver the message back to KOOMPI team. 

**Why KOOMPI?**

KOOMPI is an open-source laptop with our own operating system called KOOMPI OS. We believe that using an open-source OS allows more freedom in learning and encourages creativity. Each laptop given to schools is not just a donation, but an investment towards a big cause. 

Producing quality laptops is only one step towards KOOMPI’s mission. This is why we came up with [KOOMPI Academy](http://learn.koompi.com), a technology-oriented educational project that aims to provide learners with three resources: **tools, courses, and mentors.**

**How can users benefit from KOOMPI Academy?**
 
KOOMPI Academy was made to help students of all ages, especially young students who want to explore STEM. There are numerous courses in the application and the number will keep growing. In KOOMPI Academy, you can be a learner or a mentor. 

Learners are users who view lessons. These lessons are stored on a local cache, making them available regardless of internet connection. The app also tracks learners’ progress and acts as a navigator for the learner. 

Mentors are users who build and upload lesson courses. Mentors can view other mentors’ work as well.

## One-Notebook-Per-Student

One-Notebook-Per-Student is an extensive mission of One-School-One-Lab. KOOMPI does not only build tools. We want to build engineers and developers. This is only possible when every student is given sufficient support. In addition to computer labs, we want everyone to be equipped with their own tools. 

This is not the first initiative taken.
