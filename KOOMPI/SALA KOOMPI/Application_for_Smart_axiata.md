### About Company: (input into microsoft form)
As the world is moving forward into advanced technology-based infrastructures, we see that a lot of demands can be tackled with the help of technology. KOOMPI was created with an ambitious mission, to build tools for and to create the next generation of engineers, problem solvers, and discoverers. 

Our company was established by a group of technology-enthusiasts who wants to connect people to the world of computing.  Inspired by an ancient book called **"គម្ពីរ"** known as BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE, KOOMPI (our debut open-sourced product) is a practical, affordable and effective entry-level notebook computer specifically designed for performing all daily tasks required for work and school. We've created a customized operating system of our own called KOOMPI OS based on the well-known open-source Linux software.

Both our philosophy and software selections provide a perfect fit with the sleek and practical KOOMPI hardware. Our integrated software suite allows KOOMPI users to challenge themselves as they explore their own personal world of computing.

### Overview

*Please describe or provide an overview of the initiative, including the problem statement, proposed idea, scope, target areas and how the initiative responds to the current COVID-19 crisis (maximum 400 words).*

KOOMPI Academy is KOOMPI’s educational project focusing on giving Cambodian students an autonomous and enriching E-Learning experience. Though Cambodia is adapting to the new digital industrial age, not all of Cambodia’s educational institutions are necessarily equipped with enough resources to conduct digital learning. This is a barrier for Cambodian students to fully immerse in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics).

The project is part of our One-School-One-Lab and One-Notebook-Per-Student mission in which we partner with public and private schools to open computer laboratories with sufficient number of computers to aid students in STEAM. So far, we have installed KOOMPI Linux Labs in three private schools and six public schools (in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Kandal). Each school have been provided with a minimum of 30 KOOMPI laptops and one facilitator (a trained specialist from KOOMPI who assists teachers and students in the labs). 

In addition, KOOMPI Academy (the application) was developed by KOOMPI to promote digital learning for students of all ages. Students can access the platform through academy.koompi.com or the built-in application on KOOMPI laptops. The application allows for students to view lessons and for teachers to create lessons, making it a virtual classroom. Currently, there are ( 150+ courses with around 2000+ video lessons courses, all of which were curated for Cambodian students. 

As students must study at home due to the CoVid-19 pandemic, we see that KOOMPI Academy can be a direct solution to students and teachers. Though our Linux labs cannot be of use at the moment due to social distancing, the application remains a useful learning platform regardless of the users’ geographical location.  

### Objective

KOOMPI ACADEMY has the following objectives: 
- To promote computers as learning tools to learners
- To introduce open and self-directed learning method to learners
- To promote social and peer-to-peer learning via online and offline learning community

### Expected Outcome
- Students and teachers 


### Action Plan and Timeline
*Please outline the execution plan of the initiative. This includes, but is not limited to, the timelines, resources, rollout scope, outreach and marketing plans until closure/conclusion. If the program/project is not a one-off (extends beyond the COVID-19 outbreak), please state your plans for the future.*

We recognize that the sudden transition from traditional classroom to remote digital learning might be challenging for teachers and students alike. We want to remove this barrier by providing guidance and resources to schools, starting with those we already partnered with. 

- **Physical material:**We will assess the physical materials that teachers need in this transition period so they can be provided (based on budget). 
- **Exclusive domain:** We plan to build one domain (accessible through academy.koompi.com) exclusively for public schools that we partnered with. This platform will host lessons created by the schools’ teachers and will act as the schools’ classrooms. 
- **Technical training:** In addition to providing equipments, teachers will be trained on the technical aspects of creating and uploading lessons onto their sala.koompi.com page.

### Timeline
- April 2020: Official launch of KOOMPI Academy application 
- April 2020: support chroy jangva and 2 public school at SR to create lesson content
- May 2020: get official partners for sala.koompi.com
