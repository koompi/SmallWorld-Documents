# SALA KOOMPI Concept paper

KOOMPI Sala, formerly called KOOMPI Academy, is an eLearning platform that aims to enable a decentralized and open-ended education for Cambodian students. The website (sala.koompi.com or academy.koompi.com) can be accessed for free by everyone and caters to students as young as ones from the kindergarten level. 

## Who can use KOOMPI Sala
KOOMPI Sala is not only for students, though “student” is the default user type for all new users. There are many roles users can take on when using the platform, which are Principal, Teacher, and Student. We will break each role down below. 

**Principal** 
Anyone who is credible enough to “create a school” can have the Principal badge. The role of the principal is to manage their “school” and oversee the activities of their assigned teachers in the respective school. To be a Principal, you need to submit
<__>.

**Teacher**
A Teacher is someone who may or may not belong to any school on the website. He or she can upload their lesson contents and view lessons by other Teachers. The latter activity means they can also be a “Student”, meaning users can play multiple roles. 

**Student**

A Student is a default user type. Students can view any free lesson, buy premium contents,  record their progress as they go, and generally navigate as a learner on the website. Students can rate contents they view as well, which acts as a feedback to the Teachers who created them. 


## Contents on KOOMPI Sala

KOOMPI Sala offers a wide variety of content for users. Our focus and goal are to inspire and encourage Cambodian students to enjoy learning STEAM subjects, inside and outside of their classrooms. 

**Subjects:**

- Science 
- Technology 
- Engineering 
- Arts 
- Mathematics

In terms of availability, KOOMPI Sala offers two types of contents. Here are the differences.

**Free lessons**

By default, all users can access a big number of free lessons. These contents can sometimes be redirected from Youtube (views will go directly to the original creator), or originally made by the KOOMPI Sala Teacher. This does not mean that all lessons from the Teacher will be free because they have the option to release Free or Premium content. 

**Premium lessons**

Teachers can earn revenue through Premium lessons, content that cannot be found anywhere else. Premium lessons have to be original and not stolen from other users. All videos categorized as Premium will have a distinct watermark at the bottom corner. This means the video has been reviewed by KOOMPI Sala moderator. Students have to pay to access this content.

## Learning Progress

On the left panel, the Student can click “My Courses” to view their learning history and keep track of what they have learned so far. 

## Quality Control 

Contents that are uploaded into KOOMPI Sala will go through reviewing from the KOOMPI Sala moderator team to prevent the following content from being released into the platform: 
- Irrelevant/Uneducational
- Low-quality in visual/audio (visually/auditory incomprehensible)
- Plagiarized 
- Pornographic
- Extremely out-of-date and inapplicable (especially for computer science subject)
- Racist 
- Sexist
- Homophobic
- Discriminatory

Though we have these rules in place, we allow Teachers freedom related to the subject they want to share. The rule of thumb is appropriate, inoffensive, and safe for the target students.

Students who come across any content that seems to be disturbing or worrying may report it so moderators can review it before deciding to take it down or keep it.

Teachers on KOOMPI Sala do not need official credentials as long as they are capable of making quality content. However, Principals need to submit some form of evidence to ensure that they aren’t a fake user.
