### Why was the company founded?

SmallWorld in short was founded in 2011 as “SmallWorld Cambodia” based on the merit of next-generation power innovation. One of the company's goals is to build a vibrant startup community by providing a platform for aspiring youth entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts to meet and co-create their dream company, while at the same time providing other support such as seeds financial assistance in exchange for a small stake of their future success.

After five years of steady growth, SmallWorld Cambodia evolved to be SmallWorld Venture, a firm that helps entrepreneurs to test, refine, design startup models, build and launch fast with small capital and meet like-minded entrepreneurs.

### How was the name SmallWorld created/chosen?

2 years prior to starting SmallWorld, one of the co-founders, Rithy Thul, was hosting a monthly meetup called Khmer Young Entrepreneur. The community was quickly attracting many young like-minded individuals to meet and share business ideas, concerns, and opportunities in its monthly meetup. Soon people meet each other and realize that the person whom they are meeting also knows their friends. We usually say “Oh, it’s a small world”.

The same year of the founding of SmallWorld, Rithy traveled to the USA for a summer job at a summer camp in Vermont. At the camp, there was a newly creative game called “Small World”, where kids learn about the world from a small circle of land in the woods. 

Realizing that if we make the world small, the problem in the world would be smaller and easier to solve. This realization made Rithy want to make a digital version of the game when he returned to Cambodia. 

Building such an online game in 2011 would be one of the biggest undertakings for anyone in Cambodia. Thus, the decision was to create a reality of the small world game as a free (freedom) workspace where people can express themselves and their talents. Hopefully, eventually we could gather enough people with technical knowhow to help build such educational games for the next generation. Thus, SmallWorld was started and the rest is history.
